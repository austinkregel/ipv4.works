# [ipv4.works](https://ipv4.works)
This is just meant to be a dead simple service that gives you your current IPv4 address.

Meant to be used in scripts that need the host's ip address.
 
### Is there tracking? 
There is tracking through Cloudflare, however individual requests are not logged. I can see aggregated data like the total number of requests, or the number of requests for a country, but not anything more granular.
